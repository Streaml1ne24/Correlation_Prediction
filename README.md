# Correlation_Prediction
The correlation and prediction repository is an extension of Ryan Baxter's "Professional" branch.

"Correlation_Prediction" repository is for demonstrating professional proficiency in creating correlation and prediction models.
Each project in the repository will be based on community, city, county, or state open data; there will be some projects that come
from business or sports open data.
